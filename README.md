# Weather-Data-Plotting
I first aquired a weather data set that includes a date, average daily wind speed, precipitation, average relative humidity, average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature. I then built a program that, for a certain month in a certain year, would give the following data: mean average daily temperature, mean relative humidity, mean daily wind speed, and percentage of days without precipitation. I then also build a program that would plot maximum temperature and average wind speeds vs date, number of days vs average wind speed, precipitation vs average relative humidity, and average temperature vs month.
